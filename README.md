Currently, its a collection of bits and pieces, scripts and notes
exploring how one can leverage open source LLMs and free computing
resources to build various pipelines. The first effort in this
collection seeks to explain how to extract characters and their
descriptions from novels.

## Read notes ##
The notes are published here in the sequential order:

1. [Introduction](https://www.pashakhin.org/sepulchral-fizz/notes/00-intro.html)

## Usage ##

I recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to recreate the
Python environment and install all the dependencies.

```{shell}
uv sync
```

## Name ##
`sepulchral fizz` is a randomly generated code name for the project 
similarly to [the naming convention of Ubuntu
releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Naming_convention).
The randomly generated name is adapted so sound `dickensian.'
